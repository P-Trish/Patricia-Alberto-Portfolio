Hello World! This is my professional portfolio.  
My motivation for creating this project is to showcase all the projects I have built during the UCLA Full Stack Bootcamp while demonstrating the skills I learned in React to develop my professional portfolio.

When an employer arrives on the landing page of my portfolio they are met with the "About Me" page.  In the header is a navigation bar with links to my Portfolio of projects on display, Contact Page with form to reach me and leave a message, and Resume page with a link to a .pdf file of my resume.  On every page is the footer with the GitHub and LinkedIn logos with links to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages embedded.
